# Random Forest Classifier for Iris Species Prediction

## Overview

This project utilizes the Random Forest Classifier algorithm to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset used is the well-known Iris dataset, containing features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Graphviz (for visualizing decision trees)

### Installation
